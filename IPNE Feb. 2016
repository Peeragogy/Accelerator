We propose to conduct a four-session Peeragogy Accelerator for the Independent Publishers of New England (IPNE.org) starting in Feb. 2016.

REQUEST:
Charlotte Pierce, a Peeragogy Project member, is also President of the IPNE board of directors and has requested the Accelerator with the intention of increasing collaboration and cooperativism in this geographically distributed (6 New England states) nonprofit, volunteer run organization. She and the Board will also be carrying out the organization's 2016 theme, "Collaboration Is the New Competition, introduced at our 2015 Annual Conference in September, 2015.

HISTORY:
IPNE was formed out of a similar mmeandering organization in about 2000, about the time it became clear that self, or independent, publishing technology was democratizing and empowering a tidal wave of indies unwilling to wait for a chance to "break into" traditional publishing. In increasingly large numbers, these publishers were knocking at the gates hitherto kept according to strict rules by traditional publishers, primarly in New York. 

The primary movers in this early period of IPNE were Tordis Isselhardt of Images from the Past in Bennington, VT and Pamela Fenner of Michaelmas Press in Amesbury, MA. Other primary movers in the early days were Shel Horowitz of Principled Profit in Western MA, Steve Carlson of Upper Access Books in Vermont, and Charlotte Pierce, who joined as a member in 2007 and has served in several Board postions.



CONTEXT/FORCES:
- IPNE came into being and continues to evolve in a time of tremendous technological change in the publishing industry, and in the way entrepreneurs do business. 
- The founders put in thousands of hours on tasks large and small, as have successive incarnations of the Board of Directors and Event coordinators.
- Besides the founders, very few Board members have lasted more than a few months to a year in the positions. 
- Every year in early December, a slate of candidates is prepared by a Nominating Team and voted on according to the Bylaws.
- IPNE now counts about 200 members, largely independent authors, but about 25% small publishers producing the work of others, and 25% service vendors to the industry.

RESOURCES:
We will provide access to historical documents and platforms as requested by the Peeragogy Acclerator participants.
