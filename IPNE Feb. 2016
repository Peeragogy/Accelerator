We propose to conduct a four-stage Peeragogy Accelerator for the Independent Publishers of New England (IPNE.org) starting in Feb. 2016.

REQUEST:
Charlotte Pierce, a Peeragogy Project member, is also President of the IPNE board of directors and has requested the Accelerator with the intention of increasing collaboration and cooperativism in this geographically distributed (6 New England states) nonprofit, volunteer run organization. She and the Board will also be carrying out the organization's 2016 theme, "Collaboration Is the New Competition, introduced at our 2015 Annual Conference in September, 2015.

HISTORY:
IPNE was formed out of a similar mmeandering organization in about 2000, about the time it became clear that self, or independent, publishing technology was democratizing and empowering a tidal wave of indies unwilling to wait for a chance to "break into" traditional publishing. In increasingly large numbers, these publishers were breaking through gates hitherto kept according to strict rules by traditional publishers, primarly in New York. 

The primary movers in this early period of IPNE were Tordis Isselhardt of Images from the Past in Bennington, VT and Pamela Fenner of Michaelmas Press in Amesbury, MA. Other participants in the early days were Shel Horowitz of Principled Profit in Western MA, Steve Carlson of Upper Access Books in Vermont, and Charlotte Pierce, who joined as a member in 2007 and has served in several Board postions.



CONTEXT/FORCES:
- IPNE came into being and continues to evolve in a time of tremendous technological change in the publishing industry, and in the way entrepreneurs do business. The organization did not always cope with this change well.
- The founders put in thousands of hours on tasks large and small, over a period of 15 or so years, and are extremely attached to the organization. They are no longer on the board, but both were coordinators of our Annual Conference in 2015 and continue to represent IPNE around the region.
- Several key participants persist in conducting business in an atmosphere of secrecy or using old technologies like email and phone conferencing, or insisting on physical meetings, which are next to impossible given the large geographic area.
- Besides the founders, very few Board members have lasted more than a few months to a year in the positions. There has been rampant quitting soon after election and lack of clarity about roles by new Board members. 
- Every year in early December, a slate of candidates is prepared by a Nominating Team and voted on according to the Bylaws.
- IPNE now counts about 200 members, largely independent authors, but about 25% small publishers producing the work of others, and 25% service vendors to the industry.
- With an all-new board in 2015 and several members announcing their retreat from active roles, much of the operations has devolved upon the current president; other board members don't have a good grasp of the big picture and look to the president for assignments or guidance.
- Member contact is spread unevenly across platforms like Facebook, Twitter, IPNE.org blog, email.
- President is primarily responsible for maintaining the website (other members don't have the experience or are reluctant to take on this task). This includes designing, testing, and maintaining complicated registration forms for our cooperative marketing Events, a primary member benefit.

RECENT CHANGES:
- Regular member video hangouts (though responsibility falls to the President, who produces these Hangouts). Members are able to organize them with the  permanent link, but aren't motivated to do so, or aren't clear about how it's done.
- Addition of Asana.com as a project management tool - met with both positive adoption and passive opposition (from forgetfulness to intentional non-use) by various team members.
- Monthly Hangouts for Board meetings.
- Increased sharing of documents on platforms like Google Drive and Asana. Still confusing to many Board and team members.
- Awareness campaign for the collaboration theme. Disparaged or ignored by former board members.
- Cultivation of a set of potential desirable board members on the part of the president and other team members.

RESOURCES:
We will provide access to historical documents and platforms as requested by the Peeragogy Acclerator participants. 

DREAMS: 
- An environment or dashboard where members and Board members can quickly get up to speed.
- Clear task areas and an awareness and culture of spotting when another member needs help (like Peeragogy).
- An awareness of being on a TEAM, rather than passively serving on a Board or being a member receiving benefits.
- Exciting new benefits for collaboratively involved and aware members.
